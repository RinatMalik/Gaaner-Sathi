# Gaaner Sathi · গানের সাথী

A practice companion for singers who learn Bengali songs from swaralipi (akarmatrik
notation). Type the notation once, and Gaaner Sathi plays the melody on harmonium as a
pitch guide, with tabla, dholak or drums in any of sixteen taals (Tagore's own six among
them) and a tanpura drone, all on one clock so the rhythm never drifts from the melody.
It highlights the beat you are on, with the lyric underneath. It keeps a library of your
songs, each with its own sound, listens through the microphone and shows how in tune you
sing, note by note, runs a daily rewaz routine hands-free, and logs your practice.
Everything stays on your device.

## Status

The port of the original single-file prototype is finished, and the app is live. Phase 1
([roadmap](docs/ROADMAP.md)), features first: the song library, pitch feedback from the
microphone, the rewaz routine with a practice log, each song's own sound, and Tagore's
taals with four more are in; more follow as Rinat picks them. The design comes after
that, then a native mobile app.

## Try it

https://rinatmalik.github.io/Gaaner-Sathi/ keeps your songs in your browser, with no
account. Songs saved in the earlier prototype at the same address show up there too.
The prototype itself is [`reference/gaaner-sathi.html`](reference/gaaner-sathi.html):
download it and open it in a browser.

## Develop

Needs Node 24 LTS.

    npm install
    npm test            # all tests (Vitest), including comparisons with the prototype
    npm run typecheck   # TypeScript, including the DOM-free check on src/core
    npm run dev         # dev server: the app at /, the audio check at /dev/render.html
    npm run build       # the published files, in dist/

`bash reference/tests/run-all.sh` runs the prototype's own suites. GitHub Actions runs
everything on every push to `main`.
